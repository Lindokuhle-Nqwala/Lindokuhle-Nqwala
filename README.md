# 💫 About Me:
Hello 👋 
I’m Lindokuhle Nqwala<br>Beginner Python Developer.<br> 
I am already comfortable with CSS and HTML, and so I am building projects while using them. My end goal is to be a Software Developer, but I am currently focused on Full Stack Web Development, hence I am presently learning Flask, Django and SASS.
